# Pandas

## What is the most common use of the pandas lib in Python? 


NumPy is a popular library in Python for numerical computing, and its most 
common use is for working with arrays or matrices of numeric data. NumPy 
provides a powerful N-dimensional array object, which allows for efficient 
computations and manipulations of large datasets. 

Some of the most common uses of NumPy include: 

**Mathematical operations:** NumPy provides a wide range of mathematical 
operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and more. 
These operations can be performed on arrays and matrices, making it easy to 
apply the same operation to a large dataset. 

**Data manipulation:** NumPy allows you to manipulate data easily, such as 
indexing, slicing, and reshaping arrays. This can be useful for data cleaning 
and preprocessing. 

**Linear algebra:** NumPy provides a suite of linear algebra functions, including 
matrix multiplication, matrix inversion, and eigenvalue decomposition. These 
functions are useful for applications such as machine learning and scientific 
computing. 

**Random number generation:** NumPy includes a powerful random number generation 
library that can generate random numbers from a variety of distributions. 

Overall, NumPy is a versatile library that can be used for a wide range of 
numerical computing tasks in Python.
